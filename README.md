## React Fundamentals Project
#### React Nanodegree (Udacity)
Project submission by Edward Minnett (ed@methodic.io).

## Overview

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of the project is to demonstrate an understanding of the React Javascript framework as well as the best practices for the use of React when building single page applications.

The project takes the form of a simple 'library' where books can be assigned to one of three shelves ('Currently Reading', 'Want to Read', or 'Read'). The application includes the ability to search for books so they can be assigned to these shelves or removed from them altogether. Please note, however, the search functionality only supports a small set of predetermined querries. Individual letters of the alphabet return results as well as the terms listed in `SEARCH_TERMS.md`.

**NB:** The API this application depends upon is hosted by Udacity and is subject to change.

## Setup

To run the application, clone the project to a local directory and execute the following:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

The application will then be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.
